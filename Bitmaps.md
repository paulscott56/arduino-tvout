# Introduction #

This wiki covers the creating and usage of bitmaps.  I currently run windows on the machine I use for development so these directions are for windows only until someone can provide better directions/directions for linux/macs.


# Creating a bitmap #

  1. Get [Image2Code](http://www.crystalfontz.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5854) a handy little program that will do most of the work for you.
  1. Now create a bitmap that is a 1bit grayscale bmp. (I have literally no image editing experience so you are on your own here I have just been using paint.)
  1. Launch Image 2 Code.
  1. Select Browse and choose the bitmap you have created.
  1. hoose the third option form the left the one that says MSB LSB the default selections for this mode are correct.
  1. Make sure Invert Image is checked at the bottom and C Array Writer is chosen.
  1. Click Convert and notepad will open up with your bitmap definitions.
  1. Now create a .h This one is called TVOlogo.h:
```
# include <avr/pgmspace.h>
# ifndef TVOLOGO_H
# define TVOLOGO_H

extern const unsigned char TVOlogo[];
#endif
```
  1. Next create a .cpp file, you will copy the image data into this removing the { from the beginning of each line and the } from the end of each.  Also you must add the width then the height of the image to the beginning of the file like so TVOlogo.cpp:
```
#include "TVOlogo.h"
PROGMEM const unsigned char TVOlogo[] = {

  1. Save these in your sketch's directory
  1. Use your bitmap like so: TV.[bitmap](Bitmap.md)(x,y,Bitmap);
